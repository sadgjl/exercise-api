test api response with cucumber and testng

Hi, tech team. I did the task according to the criteria without adding anything extra. There is only one reporting tool in the project (target, but often I also add logs and listeners on fail (so that they write logs only in case of failure). Also, often I use global properties to store some parameters, for example, the base URI, but this project is quite simple and I didn't use them. Well, for all the requirements, I tried to avoid the hardcoded values, made them flexible so that it would be convenient to make changes in future. Thank you for the interesting task, I hope that all the criteria are met and the test works correctly. I tested how it works (I made a similar database on my local host and for all the parameters my testing went as expected). I hope my code passes your tests. Have a nice day and excited to hear any feedback from you
